        Issues without minimal reproductions will be closed! Please provide a link to one by:
        1. Using the REPL at https://rollupjs.org/repl/, or
        2. Using the StackBlitz reproduction template at https://stackblitz.com/fork/rollup-repro (allows full use of all rollup options and plugins), or
        3. Using the repl.it reproduction template at https://replit.com/@rollup/rollup-plugin-repro, or
        4. Provide a minimal repository link (Read https://gist.github.com/Rich-Harris/88c5fc2ac6dc941b22e7996af05d70ff for instructions). These may take more time to triage than the other options.
          
        For some bugs it this may seem like overkill but believe us, very often what seems like a "clear issue" is actually specific to some details of your setup. Having a runnable reproduction not only "proves" your bug to us but also allows us to spend all our effort fixing the bug instead of struggling to understand your issue.
